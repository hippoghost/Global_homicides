# Global_homicides
SQL analysis of global homicide trends


In this project, we'll work with data from Undata and more particularly with Intentional Homicide Victims by counts and rates per 100,000 population.

The original file was an xls file that was converted and cleaned with the use of Python in two different csv files. The final csv that we used for our analysis was loaded in DB Browser for SQLITE.

In this project, we'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyze data from this database.

Dataset "intentional homicides count":

It is composed of 270 rows and 24 columns.

Region - large geographic area that can contain multiple countries.
Subregion - smaller geographic area within a region that can contain multiple countries or parts of a country.
country - self-governing geographic area with distinct borders and a unique government.
source - 
year2000-year2020- absolute homicides number per year
