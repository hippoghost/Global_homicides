# Global_homicides SQL analysis

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

In this project, we will conduct a comprehensive data analysis of a homicide dataset from UNDATA using SQL. We chose this dataset for a number of reasons:

* The dataset is rich in insights
* The analysis has the potential to improve public safety
* The dataset is of public interest

We will use SQL to manipulate, query, and aggregate data, thus identifying trends and patterns, while DB Browser will facilitate data exploration.




## DATA
The original file was an xls file that was converted and cleaned with the use of Python in two different csv files. The final csv that we used for our analysis was loaded in DB Browser for SQLITE.

### Dataset "intentional homicides count":

It is composed of 270 rows and 24 columns.

    Region - large geographic area that can contain multiple countries.
    Subregion - smaller geographic area within a region that can contain multiple countries or parts of a country.
    country - self-governing geographic area with distinct borders and a unique government.
    source - 
    year2000-year2020- absolute homicides number per year
    
 The final dataset consists of two CSV files that were joined together:

* number.csv - provides information about the total number of homicides per country, region, and subregion.
* rates.csv - contains information about the rates of homicides per country, region, and subregion.

 This allowed for greater clarity, readability, and understanding. All of the datasets used in this project can be found in our GitHub repository.
    
## GOALS

* Show how to manipulate, query and aggregate data using SQL to identify trends and patterns.
* Demonstrate how to facilitate data exploration using DB Browser.
* Explain how to import and merge CSV files into a single dataset for complex analysis.
* Provide insights on homicide rates in various countries and regions by using SQL queries to filter and sort data.
